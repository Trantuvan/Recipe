          Place the sliced beef into a flat, ovenproof dish. Stir the red wine
          vinegar, 1/2 cup olive oil, lemon juice, allspice, cinnamon, cardamom,
          black pepper, salt, tomatoes and garlic together in a bowl until well
          blended. Pour over the beef, turning slices to coat evenly. Cover, and
          refrigerate 4 hours.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>

          Remove the cover from the dish with the beef, and cook in preheated
          oven until the meat is no longer pink, about 50 minutes. Cool
          slightly.

          Meanwhile, make the parsley sauce by mixing the parsley, sweet onion,
          and 1/2 cup olive oil together in a bowl. Place the tomatoes in a
          bowl, and set aside until needed.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          Make the tahini sauce by mixing the garlic, tahini, lemon juice, and
          water together in a bowl. Season to taste with salt.

          To serve, place the pita bread rounds on serving plates. Spoon some of
          the meat mixture down the center of each pita round. Top with the
          parsley mix, tomatoes, and tahini sauce. Roll up the sides of the pita
          bread around the filling, and serve.
