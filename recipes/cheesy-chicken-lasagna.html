    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Cheesy lasagna made using shredded chicken in place of ground beef or
      sausage.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 each skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 (26.5 ounce) cans spaghetti sauce, divided</li>
      <li>2 (15 ounce) containers part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat and add
          chicken breasts; reduce heat and let simmer until chicken falls apart
          easily with a fork and is no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain
          water, shred chicken with 2 forks, and set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          While chicken is boiling, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to
          a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
          occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
          Drain and lay noodles in a single, flat layer on a paper towel to dry.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat butter in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion
          and garlic in the hot butter just until onion is translucent, 5 to 7
          minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mix shredded chicken, onion-garlic mixture, 1 cup spaghetti sauce,
          ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning
          together in a large bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Mix remaining spaghetti sauce and remaining Parmesan cheese together
          in another bowl. Spread a thin layer on the bottom of a glass
          9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles, spread chicken mixture
          on top, then add another thin layer of the sauce mixture. Repeat,
          leaving a final layer of noodles on top. Top with remaining sauce.
          Sprinkle mozzarella and Cheddar cheese on top.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese bubbles,
          about 45 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
